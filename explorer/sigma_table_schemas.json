A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status.

Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). \n\nIf subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that.
